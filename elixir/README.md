# Little Kidogo Software Apprenticenship Curriculum 

This is a 12 week timeline that is designed to take an indvidual from 0 to a place where they be productive and explore of their own accord. This being an avenue to employment aims to arm you with the neccessary tools to enable you to garner enough experience to accomplish tasks assigned assigned you.

The whole point of this program isn't to teach any one programming language or `stack` rather to get participants to a point where they can choose what and how to learn it. 

Consider this some sort of `Choose your own adventure` experience
