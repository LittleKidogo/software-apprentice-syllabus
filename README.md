# Little Kidogo Software Apprenticenship Curriculum

This is a 12 week timeline that is designed to take an indvidual from any starting point to a point where they are productive and explore of their own accord.

This being an avenue to employment aims to arm you with the neccessary tools to enable you to garner enough experience to accomplish tasks assigned assigned you.

The whole point of this program isn't to teach any one programming language or `stack` rather to get participants to a point where they can choose what and how to learn it.

Consider this some sort of `Choose your own adventure` experience


This is a living document that could change without warning and hence is provided as is.


## How it works 
1. A call for application will be placed for a specific apprenticeship path 
2. Applicants will go through interviewing for the apprentinceship 
3. Successful interview candidates will be admitted into the apprentinceship and matched to a mentor or mentors
4. Apprentices shall go through a 4 to 12 week program depending on the pace of the candidate 
5. At the end of the program passing candidates stand a chance for Job Offers from Little Kidogo and Friends


## How to ace as an Apprentice
1. As an apprentince as you go through the program you will be expected to consume the coursework in sections of weeks
2. Each week will contain some topics, study material and some challenges, apprentices will be expected to complete and submit their challenges before 6pm UTC +2 every Friday.
3. Apprentices will be expected to submit weekly reviews on their work and progress on Wednesdays by 6pm UTC +2
4. Apprentices will have access to three 40 minute pair sessions each week during these sessions. We have noticed that such sessions are much better when candidates work with mentors as a group (so gang up!)
5. Apprentices will be expected to post daily progress reports detailing their intentions and progress so far, (it's usually one line answers to 4-5 questions that can be answered almost any time)
6. Each week of the apprenticeship, apprentices shall expected to make a small report detailing what they have learned. This is usually submitted as a short blog post.


## How to ace as a Mentor 
1. Mentors will be expected to be available and accomodative to their apprentices 
2. Mentors will be charged with listening to their mentees 
3. Mentors will be expected to follow up with their mentees and try and maintain a stability in learning
4. Mentors will be expected to review their mentees in a manner that is open and empathic 
5. Apprentices will be expected to submit weekly reviews on their work and progress on Wednesdays by 6pm UTC +2


Little Kidogo wishes to thank everyone who has been involved in making this apprenticeship possible for their time and the opportunity.
